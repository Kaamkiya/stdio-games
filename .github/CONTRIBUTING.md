# Contributing

If you just want me to add a game, create an issue for this repo. 

So, you want to contribute? If you want to add a game, make a pull request with your game added in it. 

### If you make a PR

Any games you add must be well commented. This repository is meant to be for everyone from beginner to advanced. 

Games must also be a maximum of 250 lines. This was picked randomly, but too much more becomes hard to understand.
