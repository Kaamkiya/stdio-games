# Contributing

If you just want me to add a game, create an issue for this repo. 

If you want to request a language, fill out the feature request template.

## If you make your own game

Any games you add must be well commented. This repository is meant to be for everyone from beginner to advanced. 

Games must also be a maximum of 250 lines. This was picked randomly, but too much more becomes hard to understand.
