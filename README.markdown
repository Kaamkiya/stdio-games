# stdio-games

A collection of games and animations, as well as animations, that use only the standard i/o (input/output).

They are coded in [Python](https://docs.python.org/), [Java](https://java.com/), and [C++](https://devdocs.io/cpp/).

## Installation

You need to have git installed to use these scripts. Run the following command to clone the repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Kaamkiya/stdio-games.git
```

Then `cd` into the directory:

```bash
$ cd stdio-games
```

Now you can start playing!

## Playing

### C++

To play the C++ games, you have to `cd` into the `cpp` folder. 

Then, run the following command to compile a game:

```bash
$ g++ -o a.out <GAME>.cpp
```

Don't forget to replace `<GAME>` with one of the files.

To run the code, type the follwing command and hit enter:

```bash
$ ./a.out
```

This will tell the terminal/command prompt to execute the compiled code. That's it!

### Java

> [!NOTE]
> You need to have the jdk installed to run the Java games

To run the Java games, `cd` into the folder:

```bash
$ cd java
```

Then run the following command to compile the code for a file:

```bash
$ javac <FILE>.java
```

Remember to replace `<FILE>` with the name of one of the files in the directory!

To execute the compiled code, run the following command:

```bash
$ java <FILE>
```

Where `<FILE>` is the name of the file you compiled. 

### Python

> [!NOTE]
> Please make sure you have Python installed before you try running these scripts.

The first step is to `cd` into the folder

```bash
$ python <FILE>.py
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On Linux, use `python3` instead of `python`.

It should start running the code!
